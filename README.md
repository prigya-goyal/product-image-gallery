This is a simple and responsive image gallery created using HTML and CSS. It displays a grid of images with hover effects, captions, and a clean layout.

## What It Does

- Shows a 3-column grid of images (adjusts on smaller screens)
- Applies grayscale to images by default
- Removes grayscale and shows a caption on hover
- Uses basic CSS transitions for smooth effects

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the project folder.
2. Place all your images in an assets folder inside the same directory.
3. Make sure the images are referenced correctly in index.html.
4. Open index.html in any browser.

## Files

- index.html – Contains the HTML layout for the gallery.
- styles.css – Contains all the styling, including layout, hover effects, and responsiveness.
- assets/ – Folder with your images (named like image1.jpg, image2.jpeg, etc.)

## Customization Tips

- To change how many images appear per row, edit the .card width in styles.css.
